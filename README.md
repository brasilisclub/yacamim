# Yacamim
_Yacamim_ is a [Gemini](https://geminiprotocol.net) browser. Currently, it is only available as a Command-Line Application, but in a near future,
a desktop application for linux will be launch.

### Gemini Protocol 
I could try to describe the project in a few words, but luckly, Gemini developers already did that, so let me quote them: 

> "Gemini is a new internet technology supporting an electronic library of interconnected text documents. That's not 
a new idea, but it's not old fashioned either. It's timeless, and deserves tools which treat it as a first class concept, 
not a vestigial corner case. Gemini isn't about innovation or disruption, it's about providing some respite for those who 
feel the internet has been disrupted enough already. We're not out to change the world or destroy other technologies. We 
are out to build a lightweight online space where documents are just documents, in the interests of every reader's privacy, 
attention and bandwidth."

I kinda fell in love with the idea of a simplistic internet enviroment, without all those shiny apps and adds all over the place.
Gemini became my place to go to discover new blogs and just navigate between documents.

### CLI Version
It's a basic implementation in Pytho, to have a better understanding of how I can connect to the internet via Gemini protocol, it's not supposed
to be used in a daily basis, but if you like this vintage vibe that comes from using the terminal to surf the internet, go ahead! I'll 
add some improvements to make this experience even better for y'all.

### GUI Version
That's the main application, I'm looking to develop the "backend" in [Lua](https://lualang.org) and the "Frontend" in [GTK-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/), it's
a really complex project and it might take a few months to get a working prototype, so I won't set a target date release (sorry).

### Mobile Version
It's not discarted, but also kinda farfetch for now, I aim to develop the GUI version first and then take a look at that.
